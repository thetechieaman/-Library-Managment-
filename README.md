# -Library-Managment-
I have developed a comprehensive Library Management System using Python. This system is unique as it integrates QR code technology to provide information about book availability and suggestions. It's a menu-driven program that allows users to easily check whether a book is available or not in real-time. The system simplifies library management and enhances the user experience by providing quick and accurate information. This project showcases the power of Python in developing practical and efficient solutions for real-world challenges.
